AirRaiderClone
==============

This is a copycat project of AirRaider - a mini game in WeChat. In this game, the player will move his or her fingers to manipulate the hero jet 
to shoot down enemy jets that are constantly coming from the top of the screen. The more enemies that are destroyed, the higher score the player will get.
The game is over when the hero collides with any of the enemies.

The game is developed as a hobby project using pure objective-c code. No game engine is used. All the game resources, including images and sounds, are
extracted from the official app bundle. Please do not abuse these resources or violate the copyright of the original app when forking this project.
